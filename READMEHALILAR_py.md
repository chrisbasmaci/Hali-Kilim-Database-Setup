After creating a database with my student id: db11929652
Createaschema.sql is NOT needed because I already included it in my python script
In Linux the python script can be called with:
bash InsertDataHalilar.sh ./kilimler.csv ./halilar.csv ./photos.csv localhost 5432 cinilicafe postgres chrischris




The script presumes that python 3 and pip is already installed.
All the provided material is optional, meaning you don't have to use any of it or you can use only the parts that suit you.
